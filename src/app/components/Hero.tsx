Thanks to Almighty Allah that 
MOIN ACADEMY has achieved a status that very few institutes have the privilege of having. 

We have a team of most competent and efficient professors of Karachi under whoâ€™s guidance and professional skills our students of Classes IX, X, XI & XII (Pre-Medical and Pre-Engineering groups) are able to secure top positions in the board examinations each year.

We emphasize on each and every portion of the entire syllabus and notes prepared by our experienced professors are provided to the students in original print. Frequent testing and timely result announcement besides constant contact between management and parents through most modern communication systems is what keeps Practical Centre ahead of all coaching institutes in the city.
